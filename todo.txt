File size max upload size implementation.


1) Restrict user of abusing API calls (max Tokens?)
2) Show the API Key Requirement Window on every page load until API key has been saved.
3) Check message "streaming" animation effect (typewriter effect)
4) User Preference Modal with custom username the AI will address the user.




1) Issue/Oberservation: The placeholder message/content does not reappear a second time when creating a new chat.
2) Implementation: When the User Profile button is pressed, open a modal (like the new chat modal) that has a labeled input field in which the user can set his name for Aurora/the llm chat to know and address the user.
I wanna put more "form" fields here later like hobbies, age etc that the AI will have access to.


3) Implement a modal for the "Preferences" button aswell (with the cog icon class). The modal will - for now - include one check mark form element: 3a) Hide all timestamps and 3b) a dropdown in which the user can choose a theme (which loads a different style sheet on top). Themes ONLY change the primary color values. These are 2 root variables in the css btw.

Fix: Show Placeholder on loading (together with loading states) then also load placeholder if chat history is empty)
Fix: Check if the chat history memory is implemented correctly. If not, implement the feature for the ai agent to always understand the scope of the whole chat conversation in every response.
